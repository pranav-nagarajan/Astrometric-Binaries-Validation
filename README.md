# Vaidation of Astrometric Binary Solutions in Gaia DR3 with Hierarchical Triples
This repository serves as a companion to the publication "Validation of Gaia DR3 orbital and acceleration solutions with hierarchical triples" (Nagarajan et al. 2024). In this repository, we provide both the catalog of hierarchical triples and a Jupyter Notebook to reproduce relevant plots from the associated paper.
