# Vaidation of Astrometric Binary Solutions in Gaia DR3 with Hierarchical Triples
This repository serves as a companion to the publication "Validation of Gaia DR3 orbital and acceleration solutions with hierarchical triples" (<a href=https://doi.org/10.1088/1538-3873/ad7981>Nagarajan and El-Badry 2024</a>). In this repository, we provide both the catalog of hierarchical triples and a Jupyter Notebook to reproduce relevant plots from the associated paper.
